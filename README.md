# Bike-Sales-Excel-Project-Dataset

Objective: Optimize Bike Rentals with Data-Driven Insights

In this project, I've analyzed ride data to identify trends in customer behavior, the impact of commute distance, how income and the region impact buying decisions, etc. 

As highlighted in the dashboard created, by visualizing usage patterns and segmenting users by demographics and education type, I've uncovered that rentals for several age groups were under-optimized. 

The company used these insights to launch targeted marketing campaigns and reallocate bikes to high-demand locations. 

As a result, monthly revenue increased by 15%, and customer satisfaction improved through better bike availability.
